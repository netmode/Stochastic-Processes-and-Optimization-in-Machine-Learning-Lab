# Stochastic Processes and Optimization in Machine Learning Lab
This is the repository for the postgraduate course Stochastic Processes &amp; Optimization in Machine Learning. This course is included in the Data Science &amp; Machine Learning (DSML) program of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).  
  
Our 2026 course will include the following exercises provided as Jupyter Notebooks:  
1) Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression and Logistic Regression
2) K-means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders
3) Markov Chains and Simulation
4) The Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm, Simulated Annealing
5) Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and Deep Belief Networks
6) Markov Decision Processes and Q-Learning
7) Naive Bayes Classifier (Application in DNS DDoS Cyberattack protection)
8) Radial Basis Function (RBF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors
9) Decision Trees and Random Forests
10) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Explainability (LIME, SHAP)
  
Note: Some exercises are taken from online sources and the respective code is not developed by us. We try to reference our sources as much as possible within the exercises.
