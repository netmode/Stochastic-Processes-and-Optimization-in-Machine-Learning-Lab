        "<h1><b>The Logistic Regression Algorithm</b></h1> <p align=\"justify\">In this exercise you will study the <i>logistic regression</i> algorithm by constructing a short program. In this exercise you will use the <i>Python Scikit-Learn</i> library. To facilitate your work, the import statements of the libraries you will use are provided, along with commands that include blanks. Specifically, you will build an <i>SMS spam message classifier</i>. The data you will use for training and validating the model, as well as information about them, can be found <a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection\"><i>here</i></a>.</p> <p align=\"justify\">You are asked to develop a program that:</p> <ul> <li>Will load the data from the <i>.csv</i> file.</li> <li>Will randomly split the provided data into training data <i>(training set)</i> and data for computing the model’s accuracy <i>(test set)</i>.</li> <li>Will perform preprocessing on the data using the <i>TfidVectorizer</i> method from the <i>Scikit-Learn</i> library. More information about the <i>TfidVectorizer</i> method, which is included in the program’s imports, can be found <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html\"><i>here</i></a>. Note that the <i>TfidVectorizer</i> method of <i>Scikit-Learn</i> also removes punctuation marks while processing the dataset.</li> <li>Will train the <i>logistic regression</i> model.</li> <li>Will compute its accuracy on the <i>test set</i>.</li> </ul> <p align=\"justify\">For what reasons do you think that applying the <i>linear regression</i> method is not suitable for this particular problem?</p>"
